Abstract
========

This repository contains some very old borland pascal code I wrote back in
my very early days.  This was all prior to my "real" education in computer
science, so keep your brown paper bags ready ... :)

Contents
========

**3D**
    Early 3D graphics experiments.

**BGI**
    SuperVGA BGI driver by Thomas Design, see below

**BIN**
    I have no idea, sorry.

**COREWARS**
    A core wars implementation

**FINITEL**
    Some experiment for a physics simulation.

**GAUSS**
    A gauss solver.

**LAGERBER**
    A simple mechanics solver.

**LIB**
    Some libraries.

**LOGIK**
    A logic simulator.

**PARTIKEL**
    A particle system.

**QBIST**
    A graphics demo program, most probably inspired by Scientific American
    "Computer Fun" series articles.

**QUELL**
    Some implementations for "Computer Kurzweil" problems

**RAY**
    A ray tracer.

**REC_TRA**
    Another ray tracer.

**SNIPP**
    Pascal snippets, not coede by me, but in PD.

**SYMB**
    Mostly empty :)

**UNITS**
    Contains a SVGA driver unit -- probably derived work.

**UBUNGEN**
    Contains one assignment solution from my first programming course, this
    is probably one of the youngest program ;)

All The code is WTFPL -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL,
except:

- all code in `BGI` which I included only because some of the graphics
  stuff probably won't work.  This code is (C) by "Thomas Design 1985"

- The code in `SNIPP` are various pascal snippets, (C) by those who are
  mentioned in the snippets.
