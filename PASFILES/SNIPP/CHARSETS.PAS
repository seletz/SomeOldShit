Subj : ASM to redefine charset

Alright, try to solve this problem. The procedure I made in asm works as long
as i don't pass the parameter data as an argument, that is as long as data is a
const : array[1..16] of byte = (......);

Here is the procedure :

Procedure SetAsciiChar(Charnum : Word; Var Data); Assembler;
ASM
   mov ah,11h
   mov al,10h
   mov bh,10h
   mov bl,0
   mov cx,1      {set 1 character only}
   mov dx,charnum     {what charnum to modify }
   mov bp,seg data   {seg of the char}
   mov es,bp
   mov bp,offset data  {ofs of the char}
   int 10h
End;

Hope you can transform it so that Data can be passed as a parameter to the
procedure. I'm new to this Pascal-ASM stuff. I you come up with anything, let
me know.


By the way, I'll tell you how to make textmode have 80chars x 43 chars in the
next few days, I know of a way, give me time to try it.
