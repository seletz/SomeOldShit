Here's how you do just that!: }

Program CapsONandOFF;

const
  CapsLockOn   = $40;
  {and for an added bonus here's some more values to use:}
  InsertOn     = $80;
  NumLockOn    = $20;
  ScrollLockOn = $10;

var
  KeyFlag : byte absolute $0040:$0017;
Begin
  KeyFlag := KeyFlag or CapsLockOn;
  readln;
  KeyFlag := KeyFlag and (not CapsLockOn);
End.
