CB>  -  What's the CHARACTER that is returned when you hit your arrow keys?  I'

CB>     ie. When you hit Return/Enter key it gives out #13

CB>   Could you lay out the commands for all 4 arrow keys like so:


CB>                                /-\  up arrow = ??
  >                                 |
  >              left arrow = ?? <-- -->  right arrow = ??
  >                                 |
  >                                \_/
  >                                     down arrow = ??

Try using this program to figure out how to use it:}

Program Ordinal;

Uses Crt;

Var Letter: Char;
I: Integer;

Begin
  TextBackGround(Black);
  TextColor(LightGray);
  Clrscr;
  Repeat
    Letter:=ReadKey;
    If Letter=#0 then Begin
      Letter:=ReadKey;
      Writeln('Special characters: 0, ',Ord(Letter),' (',Letter,')');
    End Else Writeln(Letter,' = ',Ord(Letter));
  Until Letter=#27; {Escape}
End.

This will show you how to use arrow keys, F-keys, and Alt-key (and a few
other keys)!
