**** SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS PROGRAM OR THE UNITS IT USES! ****

it leaves mouse trails on the screen, seemingly at random, and I can't figure
it out. PLEASE HELP! It only happens when hiding and showing the mousecursor,
if you just leave it on all the time it's fine (but you have to hideit
sometimes if you modify the screen at all...)

I've tried disabling interrupts in various places but it doesn't help. My
logic seems to be ok, but every once in a while it will just fail to erasethe
cursor...

Whoever points out the error will get his/her name in the credits and my
eternal gratitude!! }
