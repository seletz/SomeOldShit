Ahh, ok, well, this is from nothing but my head, so I don't guarantee it
to be flawless, but here goes (oh, and my programmings not that great,
only been doing it less than a year, and it's just me and the books, so
don't expect much)

My code: }

Program Simple_DOS_Window;

{$M $8000, 0, 16384}  { Not sure if we need all that, but hey... }

Uses DOS, CRT;

VAR

  P1, P2 : Pointer;  {these may not get used}

{$F+}

  Procedure Intercept_Int29(F, CS, IP, AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, DS, ES,
                            BP : Word); Interrupt;

    Begin

      Write(chr(AX));

    end;

  {$F+}

  Begin

    GetIntVec($29, P1); {Remember that other interrupt}
    TextColor(14);
    TextBackground(1);
    Window(10, 5, 70, 15);
    CLRSCR;  {make a nice blue window on the screen}
    SetIntVec($29, Addr(Intercept_Int29)); {Set up our own interrupt}
    Exec(GetEnv('COMSPEC'), ''); {run DOS in our window}
    SetIntVec($29, P1); {Restore that old interrupt}

 end.
