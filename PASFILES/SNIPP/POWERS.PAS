 MO> 7.10 is not out. JJ is just saying the NEXT version should include

Mark, I know you aren't the guy that said there should be a power
operator, but... }

Function RaiseX (X,Y:Real) :Real;
Begin
 X:=LN(X);
 X:=(X*Y);
 X:=EXP(X);
 RAISEX:=X;
End;

{and}

Function XRt (X,Y:Real) :Real;
Begin
 X:=LN(X);
 X:=(X/Y);
 X:=EXP(X);
 XRT:=X;
End;

both work well for me... :)
